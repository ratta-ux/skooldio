# Redesign Skooldio mobile site

Nowadays people like to learn and find courses on their mobile phone.

So I would like to redesign the Skooldio mobile site to enlarge new audiences that are not in the tech industry to understand the website easily even with zero background or transition their career.

I truly believe that Skooldio can help them to achieve their goals.
